	THE GENERAL
	</h3>

		<p>
		<i> To the tune of "Big Iron" by Marty Robbins</i> <br><br>

		From the far east side of Cleveland rode a stranger one fine day <br>
		Hardly spoke to folks around 'ihm, didn't have that much to say <br>
		No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip <br>
		The stranger there among them had tha' hammah on his hip, <br>
		Hammah on his hip <br><br>

		It was early in the morning when he rode into the town <br>
		He came riding from the east side, slowly lookin' all around <br>
		"He's an drunk fightin' and fuckin'", came a whisper from each lip <br>
		"And he's here to do some business with tha' hammah on his hip, <br>
		Hammah on his hip" <br><br>
