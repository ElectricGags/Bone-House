			<h2>A Quick Message to our Visitors</h2>
			
			<p>
				Welcome to our website. This started out as a joke and spare computer and has turned into something really cool. We aimed to create the most late 90s to mid 00s website we could think of. Please feel free to explore our website. We did start from basically scratch and a few guides. This is our first time building a website so cut us a break. This website can be classified as NSFW. Remember to voice all concerns about us and your MIL to the phone number below.

			    <h2> A New Era in Shady Link Technologies  </h2>
			</center>
			
			<p>
			    The Twenty-Second of June, The Year of our Lord, Two Thousand and Twenty-Three
			</p>
			<p>
			It has been three years since the fall of the empire. Bone House is scattered across the nation like pee ejected from an airplaine. The Monarchy has set up a government-in-exile, retreating back to the ancestral territories of the North Shore. Corona and shit. Hope is not lost! The website lives again!
			</p>
			<p>The devs here at Bone House hope that you and yours have been well in our abscence from cyberspace. We did get banned from Twitter a while ago so that social media ship has sailed, as well as our YouTube page and bonehouse@gmail.com. So nuke all of that. In more uplifting news we are proud to count all 6 orignial members of the house among the alcoholics side of the fence, and we did a number on our comrades as well.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Stay tuned this summer as we bring the site online again. Kiss. XOXO.
			</p>

				<h2>New Content</h2>
			</center>
			
			<p>
				The Sixteenth of March, The Year of our Lord, Two Thousand and Nineteen
			</p>
			<p>
				All the devs here at Bone House would absolutely love to have daily or hourly posts but that shit is not happening (pay us and it could happen you greedy fucks). We are way too busy trying to keep the alcoholics at least mildly sedated and the bar stocked. Mosts of the updates to this website will come at approximately 3 A.M. Don't ask why its just when we have the best ideas (or worst you will find out soon enough). We are working on streamlining the process of developing new content or ways to send our viewers to hell. Expect more bullshit we mean "content" as the kids call it soon. 
				<br>If you are looking for more frequent content or information on how join in on the fun please calm your god damn tits and fucking check out our social media accounts (if twitter still likes us). We will have a page dedicate to those here in the coming weeks. 
			</p>

				<h2>Improved Website</h2>
			</center>
			
			<p>
				The Fifteenth of March, The Year of our Lord, Two Thousand and Nineteen
			</p>
			<p>
				After our initial release of the website, the devs here at Bone House figured a redesign was going to be needed. While our initial design was funny, we wanted to go a bit more complex as the original website was all in HTML and was just a bunch of in-line text. This new website should allow us to bring you the best content in the shittiest way possible. We thank you for you continued cooperation. Now will we ask you to kindly fuck off as you are taking up precious oxygen for the people who have a future.
